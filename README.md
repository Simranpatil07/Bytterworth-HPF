# Butterworth-HPF

In the context of Image Processing (IMP), a Butterworth High-Pass Filter (BHPF) is used for image sharpening by enhancing fine details and highlighting edges by removing low-frequency components and preserving high-frequency ones. It offers a smoother transition than an ideal high-pass filter, reducing ringing artifacts. 

Image sharpening: By attenuating low frequencies, BHPF enhances edges and fine details, resulting in a sharper image.
Smooth transition: Unlike ideal high-pass filters with sharp cutoffs, BHPF introduces a gradual transition, reducing ringing artifacts (oscillations) around edges.
Versatile: BHPF can be used for various image processing tasks, including edge detection, noise reduction, and detail enhancement.
